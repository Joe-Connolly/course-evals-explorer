# course-eval-explorer-frontend
This repository is the Reach.js frontend for the cs89-course-evals project webapp. 

cs89-course-evals is a project where a team of three Dartmouth students developed a webapp to allow students to view summary insights on Dartmouth's courses, to enable students to make better informed decisions when picking classes and professors.  For example, students can use the cs89-course-evals webapp to see what percentage of student reviews were of a positive sentiment for a class. The project was prepared for Dartmouth's CS89: Cognitive Computing with Watson.
